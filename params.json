In this version we have implemented the superficial tension and adhesive interaction between the cells and an algorithm to accelerate the numerical integration of a system with several order parameters.\r\n\r\n### Next features:\r\n - Biological Membrane;\r\n - Elasticity;\r\n - Traction forces.\r\n\r\n![alt tag](https://moreirasm.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/vid.gif?w=320)\r\n",
