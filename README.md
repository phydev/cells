# Cells


### Version 0.0.1 - unstable

This is the first version of a phase-field model that simulate a tumoral colony and a membrane. 

In this version we have implemented just the excluded contact interaction between the cells and an algorithm to accelerate the numerical integration of a system with several order parameters.

In the next version we expect to include the adhesion between the cells and a Langevin force.
