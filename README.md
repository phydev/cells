##Version 1.0.0 - Stable

This is the first version of a phase-field model that simulate a tumoral colony and a membrane.

In this version we have implemented the superficial tension and adhesive interaction between the cells and an algorithm to accelerate the numerical integration of a system with several order parameters.

In the next version we expect to include the elasticity and the traction forces exerted by the cell in the matrix.
